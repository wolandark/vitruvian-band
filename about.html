        “From the depths of sorrow and darkness, a music was born. A reckoning of<br> 
        thought and emotion, an epiphany submerged in colossal wrath and cascading<br> 
        pain, emerged as flesh and claimed control. It was then that words burdened the<br> 
        poet and the sounds of agony slithered, like gallows, around the neck of the<br> 
        bard. It was then that it was made clear, creation was inevitable. “<br> 
        <br> 
        This paragraph encapsulates the essence of what we, as a duet, are all about.<br> 
        Vitruvian is not an experiment, nor is it a mere expression, Vitruvian is our<br> 
        attempt to embrace the agency that we are burdened with.  This is, telling the<br> 
        tales that must be told, creating the sounds that must be heard and exclaiming<br> 
        the sovereignty that seeks us in and through our creation.<br> 
        <br> 
        Vitruvian's 'Devenir' is a tale of pain and anguish, abandonment and betrayal,<br> 
        and the darkness that ensnares the soul, much like a serpent coiling around its<br> 
        prey. 'Devenir' is a story of becoming, not more than man as it is often<br> 
        interpreted, nor less than man, but becoming a sovereign, an entirely distinct<br> 
        entity.<br> 
        <br> 
        Devenir is narrated through its main character, Azhdahak, with whose tale the<br> 
        LP begins. This is how Woland approaches the lyrics and the composition and the<br> 
        recordings. It is Azhdahak's voice and words that you hear. Although we have<br> 
        decided to start from the second chapter of his tale, the first chapter would<br> 
        be included in the upcoming album.<br> 
        <br> 
        Azhdahak is a man who transforms through pain, sorrow, and betrayal, wrestles<br> 
        with this transformation for centuries until, finally, embracing not his fate,<br> 
        but his becoming and newfound sovereignty. The LP guides us through this<br> 
        journey. <br> 
        <br> 
        Vitruvian's sound is a joined effort between Woland and Satyar. The unholy and <br> 
        mournful tone of Woland's guitar combined with Satyar's ferocious and melodic <br>
        approach, creates the body of music that is Vitruvian. <br> 
        <br> 
        From a technical standpoint, Vitruvian's tone is predominantly the work of<br> 
        Satyar, who is also responsible for all the mixing and mastering. <br> 
        <br> 
        The lyrics are entirely written by Woland. Most of the parts are written in<br> 
        English, but there are also some parts in Persian and Latin.<br> 
        <br> 
        The entire recording process was carried out on Linux, primarily using free and<br> 
        open-source (FOSS) plugins. We prefer the DIY approach because we believe it's<br> 
        the only way to achieve the sound, style, and results we aim for. As a result,<br> 
        we divided the responsibilities of writing and recording bass lines, along with<br> 
        other tasks, between the two of us.<br>
