                <strong>Verse One:</strong> <br>
                “Bestow thee my serpents<br>
                These snakes on my shoulders<br>
                My sorrow and weakness<br>
                Entomb them in deepness<br>
                O fertile soil<br>
                O dust and O clod<br>
                Take my serpents of wrath<br>
                Free me of this stained life”<br>
                Thus spoke the barren pit:<br>
                “Never have I taken<br>
                A serpent without the man<br>
                Come whole or nay at all”<br>
                Despair.<br>
                Now the night weights on his shoulders<br>
                Heavy, the burden of tears<br>
                He walks this Earth, odious his thoughts<br>
                With the serpents of wrath crescent<br>
                A halo but dark<br>

                <strong>Verse Two:</strong> <br>
                Turns to Man<br>
                Begging for aid<br>
                “My fellow men, you watched me break on your behalf,<br>
                Bled before you, deformed before you”<br>
                “I ask thee now; enslaved by this scorn, take my serpents of rue <br>
                Thus spoke his fellowmen:<br>
                “Dare not to call ye man”<br>
                “You didst bled for your crime”<br>
                “Now face the scorn alone”<br>
                Despair befells him<br>

                <strong>Bridge:</strong> <br>
                “Crime?”<br>
                He screams<br>
                “Crime of speaking?”<br>
                No man is free <br>
                While Yama is king <br>

                <strong>Verse Three:</strong> <br>
                O' Yama the great<br> 
                O' time, O' rue<br> 
                I shall fight you<br> 
                I will face you<br> 
                Through the valley of death <br>
                The city of the blind <br>
                Through the gates of memory <br>
                Through my thoughts <br>

                Your walls, hide your mages and guards <br>
                And those who betrayed me <br>

                They will face my wrath<br><br>
                They die like rats<br>
                They will pay with blood<br>
                They will serve my god<br>
                They will feel my pain<br>
                They will feed my friends<br>
                They will join my call<br>
                Or they will die<br>

                <strong>Outro:</strong> <br>
                The sermon of the crickets is bliss <br>
                Cursed are those who break the silence of the night <br>

                <strong>Verse One:</strong><br>
                A hateful cry <br>
                Wounded and scared<br>
                Gallows twirling<br>
                Whip writhing<br>

                A trail of blood<br>
                Coagulated line<br>

                Stars shining bright<br>
                Attesting a new dawn<br>
                Soil quaking<br>
                Etched with blood<br>
                People woke with the cries<br>
                Who is it that scars<br>

                Darkness shall spread and swallow the world<br>
                Shadows will lead and rule the streets<br>
                Fears shall spread<br>
                Like the wings of death<br>
                Tears will flow<br>

                Like the endless rivers of Styx<br>
                Waters of woe and rue<br>
                And sadness will last forever<br>

                (Persian) <br>
                نگاه کن آن گاه که آتش می شود<br>
                آن شب ستاره ها بر تن مهر کفر می شوند<br>

                نگاه کن درب دوزخ باز می شود<br>
                مرا به تو می کشد<br>
                مرا پایین می کشد<br>

                نگاه کن قلب من پرخون زخم می شود<br>
                دریده می شود <br>
                بی جان می شود<br>
                نگاه کن گردنم از دار آویخته می شود<br>

                <strong>Translation:</strong> <br>
                Lo! when fire errupts <br>
                The night when starts become seals of blasphemy on our flesh <br>
                Lo! the gates of hell expanding <br>
                pulling me in <br>
                pulling me below <br>

                Lo! my heart scars bloody and tears <br>
                It becomes lifeless <br>
                Lo! the noose around my neck <br>

                <strong>Chorus:</strong> <br>
                O' lord of light, open thy arms<br>
                Take your children of night<br>
                What in me is dark, illuminate<br>
                what is low, rise and support<br>

                <strong>Bridge:</strong> <br>
                Via in urbem miseriae sum<br>
                Via ad gentes relictas sum<br>
                Via in aeternam maestitiam sum<br>

                Elementi illi solum quem aevus non consumat<br>
                facti sunt ante me et extra aevum sto<br>
                Proicite spes omnes qui hic introeunt<br>

                Abandon all hope ye who enter here x2<br>

                <strong>Verse Two:</strong> <br>
                To the east I look and my heart is hardened with pain<br>
                To north to the south<br>
                I beckon<br>

                Wield thy pain like a weapon<br>
                I have seen the deaf and the blind and the mute<br>
                Yet I've never seen such mule<br>
                Bread for slavery<br>

                I exclaim<br>
                Death to the weak, wealth to the strong<br>

                I have with my claws and my sword <br>
                Opened their hearts and found nothing worth loving<br>
                Nothing at all<br>

                I saw tar coating their hearts<br>
                And a mist folding their brains<br>
                I have recalled the whip and the flesh<br>
                And I have never pitied them<br>

                <strong>Intro</strong><br>

                Wandered immortal <br>
                The poison eternal<br>
                Barren land at my feet<br>
                Tall I stand on my highest cliff<br>
                And I look down solemnly <br>
                Hear the laughter of a sovereign that I must become<br>
                Lives spent at my will<br>
                They perish like wilted flowers<br>

                <strong>Verse One:</strong><br>
                I’ve witnessed temples burn and<br>
                Fall to oblivion<br>
                I’ve witnessed boiling blood<br>
                Searching for a vein<br>
                I’ve seen kingdoms tremble<br>
                And kings hanged by the neck<br>
                As they looked down on son of man<br>
                Trapped in filth<br>
                I’ve seen empires crumble and<br>
                Masses, scattered<br>
                I’ve seen them reunited<br>
                O’er wars in vain<br>
                I’ve endured pain of perish<br>
                In centuries of wandering<br>
                And never seen a thing, that lasts eternal<br>

                <strong>Chorus:</strong><br>
                I witnessed the truth twisted<br>
                (And I've) Spoken yet lies were louder<br>

                Lest this darkness consume me<br>
                I’ve knelt before the lord of light<br>
                Bestow me the seed of knowing<br>
                Bless me with the light of thee<br>

                <strong>Verse Two:</strong><br>
                It was my fate to be branded<br>
                The lord of lies<br>
                Taker of thoughts<br>
                Forget not that these words are from a deceiver, bringer of cries<br>
                My will was to scatter wisdom<br>
                Just as it was to my father<br>
                Yet my fortune deemed otherwise<br>
                And I became the lord of lies<br>

                <strong>Verse One:</strong><br>
                O terrors that lay in the four corners of the world<br>
                Shadows that cradle the foulest of beasts<br>
                Hear me! For my wrath is upon this earth<br>
                O night! What say you with your screamless spout... Gaping...<br>
                Cursed be this path <br>
                Ere now I had seen such beast that fed on it's flesh and sang a lament in it's death<br>
                And that beast was this nation and that corpse was their will...<br>

                They praise me<br>
                I smite them<br>
                They praise me<br>
                I crush them<br>
                They praise me<br>

                The fabric of the universe is changed<br>
                Nature of things<br>
                From flesh rises<br>
                Immense power<br>

                O' greatest shadows <br>
                Embrace me <br>
                Like a veil they cover me <br>
                As they have foul things forever <br>

                This night of many horrors <br>
                Shields me <br>

                O' mother night as you veil shelters <br>
                My sorrows unfold <br>
                My strength is unchained <br>

                Empty and void of life I roam <br>
                Seeking nothing <br>
                A droplet an astray <br>
                A Wanderer <br>

                <strong>Outro:</strong><br>
                (Persian, from Azhdahak by Bahram Beyzaie) <br>
                ای شب! تو سیاه تر از هر شب دیگری<br>
                و دلی دیدم سیاه تر از سیاهی تو<br>

                و تازیانه ای سخت بلند<br>
                بگونه ی ماری دهان گشوده<br>
                و دهانی به سوی من گشوده<br>

                من بنگریستم<br>
                از پس تیرگی درد<br>
                و یامای پادشاه را دیدم که هشیار بود<br>
                بر من بنگریست، ژرف، و هشیار بود<br>
                اینک او مست هشیاری خود بود<br>
                و از شانه های من سرخ ترین خون من برآمده بود<br>
                تازیانه بود و تن، و تن زیر تازیانه بود<br>

                آنک زمین بخفت و آسمان به خواب رفته بود<br>
                و اینک در همه ی این گیهان به خواب رفته ی خاموش<br>
                تنها من اژدهاک با درد خود بیدار مانده بودم<br>
                و سرخ ترین خون من <br>
                تنها آتش روشن در این دشت خاموش بود<br>
                <br>

                <strong>Translation:</strong><br>
                Oh, night! You're darker than any other night,<br>
                And I saw a heart darker than your darkness.<br>

                And a tall and hard whip,<br>
                Like an open-mouthed serpent,<br>
                And a mouth opened towards me.<br>

                I looked<br>
                Beyond the darkness of pain,<br>
                And I saw Yama the king, wide awake,<br>
                Gazing deeply and soberly at me.<br>
                Now, he was sober in his consciousness,<br>
                And my reddest blood emerged from my shouldere.<br>
                There was a whip and a body, and a body under the whip,<br>

                The earth was sleeping, and the sky was asleep,<br>
                And in this whole world, everything had fallen into a silent slumber,<br>
                Only I, Azhdahak (the dragon), remained awake with my pain,<br>
                And the reddest blood of mine,<br>
                Was the only burning fire in this silent desert.<br>

                All these stars<br>
                Let them burn and dissolve<br>
                For they’re a flickers of hope that’s lost<br>

                <strong>Bridge:</strong> <br>
                Rise! Servants of the serpents<br>
                To darkest horizons<br>
                To death<br>
                By the power of the flesh<br>
                Rise!<br>
                Children of darkness align<br>

                <strong>Verse Two:</strong> <br>
                The night weights on my shoulders, burdensome<br>
                Seldom I see those starry skies<br>
                Forfeit my life to this walk of spite<br>
                Unlike a jewel<br>
                A fate so cruel<br>
                Wounded I roam with the burden of nights<br>
                Dreams of a cleansing tortures my mind<br>

                I forget that I'm merely a man<br>
                Yet enraged like a beast of man<br>

                Fire of this mortal weakness burns the husk<br>

                <strong>Chorus:</strong> <br>
                Our tongues once were maimed<br>
                Now through her do we speak<br>
                Our hand were binded<br>
                Now through her we are freed<br>

                Our eyes once blinded<br>
                Now through her do we see<br>
                By night we reclaim what by day was taken<br>
                Our hearts once in chains<br>
                Now her light has melted<br>
                Our binds and our shackles<br>
                Our coughs and our cage<br>
                We are freed in her light<br>

                <strong>Verse Two:</strong> <br>
                The cage can't hold me<br>
                I'm too strong<br>
                Pure in blood and free in thought<br>
                My vessel's hollow of wanting and lost<br>
                My blade sharpened with sweat and blood<br>

                I paste the valley like a king<br>
                Death surrounds me like a veil<br>

                I raise my voice and thousands fall<br>
                Worshiping the unholy man that I become<br>

                <strong>Outro:</strong><br>
                As swiftly as leaves flying on the winds back<br>
                My strokes shall fall<br>
                And my foes shall be corpse<br>
                Ere their last breath leaves them<br>

                Death will be a friend but different to each<br>
                To me a servant to them, relief from their pain<br>
                </p>

                <strong>Verse One:</strong><br>
                Tear out my heart that I may feel<br>
                Tear our my song that I may heal<br>
                Pluck out my eyes that I may see<br>
                Tear our my flesh that I may be free<br>

                Tear out my wings that I may walk<br>
                Tear out my lungs that I may breathe<br>
                Tear out my tongue that I may speak<br>
                Forsake that I may recall<br>

                Mindless who goest without a will<br>
                Is will itself<br>

                Cruelty of life opened my eyes and <br>
                Set me on a path to become<br>
                A beat of man<br>
                Evolve<br>
                Transcend<br>
                Become<br>

                <strong>Chorus:</strong> <br>
                Cold be hand and heart and bone,<br>
                and cold be sleep under stone:<br>
                never more to wake on stony bed,<br>
                never, till the Sun fails and the Moon is dead.<br>
                In the black wind the stars shall die,<br>
                and still on gold here let them lie,<br>
                till the dark lord lifts up his hand<br>
                over dead sea and withered land.<br>

                My hate is pure as a mother's love<br>
                Father's awe<br>
                As a son's despise who had to watch all he loved die<br>
                I hate for once I loved, for once I loved<br>

                <strong>Bridge:</strong> <br>
                My legacy is that of pain<br>
                My heritage is a constant loss <br>
                Tears flow like a torrent of fire<br>
                Burning scorching as lava<br>

                <strong>Verse Two:</strong> <br>
                Long and eerie shrieked the oaf<br>
                Loomed afar a beat abhorred<br>

                Howled in pain the wounded wolf<br>
                Sneered ajar the horned lord<br>

                Bellowed in distance the stillborn child<br>

                Roamed in vein the wraith of man<br>
                The light of joy in indulgence died<br>

                Gallows betrothed the clergyman<br>

                My heart will reap where it hath sown<br>
                And garner up it's fruit of tear<br>
                The blackest face of woe is death<br>
                And that is my lover<br>

                Become the adversary<br>
                The grand foe<br>

                Death shall free us all<br>
                Wings to fly up high x2<br>
